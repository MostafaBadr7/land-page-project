## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

 ### I manipulated the DOM for the landing page project as below ###

 1.  `const allSections` to get the sections of the page in an array / `var fragment` to make off screen DOM tree to improve performance
 2.  **Function** to add list items of the sections in the navigation bar and making it as link to each section
 3.  **Function** `getBoundingClientRect` to notice when the section is in viewport and highlight it
 4.  Making the `scroll - behavior : smooth` by adding it to the style through [JS File](js/app.js)
